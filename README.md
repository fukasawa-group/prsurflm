Official implementation of a machine learning model for **biological vs. non-biological interface classification**.

For quick access to the available Colab notebooks, see [Quick Start](#quick-start) below.

> **Status:** This repository accompanies a manuscript currently under submission.
> The code and documentation may be updated as the paper and experiments are finalized.

## Overview

This repository contains the current public codebase for the ***ESpma*** project (working title), a model for **classifying biological and non-biological interfaces**.

It is designed to:

- **integrate sequence and structure-derived signals for protein–protein interface assessment**
- **support accurate identification of native-like protein–protein interfaces**
- **provide both lightweight and structure-aware variants for flexible use across different application settings**

This repository provides:

- inference code
- training scripts
- pretrained checkpoints
- notebooks for testing and analysis

## Quick Start

### Open in Colab

You can try the current ***ESpma*** implementation directly in Google Colab without local installation.
Two notebook variants are provided:

#### ***ESpma*** (Lightweight variant)

Lightweight version for simpler evaluation and faster testing.

This notebook includes:

- environment setup
- example input preparation
- pretrained model inference
- output visualization is planned for a future update

#### ***ESpma<sub>pc</sub>*** (Integrated variant)

Sequence and structure-aware version.

This notebook includes:

- environment setup
- example input preparation
- pretrained model inference
- output visualization is planned for a future update
